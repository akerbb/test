          <b>The Kalmar Union</b> (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish:
          Kalmarunionen; Finnish: Kalmarin unioni; Latin: Unio Calmariensis) was
          a personal union in Scandinavia, agreed at Kalmar in Sweden, that from
          1397 to 1523[1] joined under a single monarch the three kingdoms of
          Denmark, Sweden (then including most of present-day Finland), and
          Norway, together with Norway's overseas colonies[N 1] (then including
          Iceland, Greenland,[N 2] the Faroe Islands, and the Northern Isles of
          Orkney and Shetland). The union was not quite continuous; there were
          several short interruptions. Legally, the countries remained separate
          sovereign states. However, their domestic and foreign policies were
          directed by a common monarch. Gustav Vasa's election as King of Sweden
          on 6 June 1523, and his triumphant entry into Stockholm eleven days
          later, marked Sweden's final secession from the Kalmar Union.[2]
          Formally, the Danish king acknowledged Sweden's independence in 1524
          at the <b>Treaty of Malmö</b>.

        <h2>Inception</h2>
        <p>
          The union was the work of Scandinavian aristocracy wishing to counter
          the influence of the Hanseatic League. More personally, it was
          achieved by Queen Margaret I of Denmark (1353–1412). She was a
          daughter of King Valdemar IV and had married King Haakon VI of Norway
          and Sweden, who was the son of King Magnus IV of Sweden, Norway and
          Scania. Margaret succeeded in having her and Haakon's son Olaf
          recognized as heir to the throne of Denmark. In 1376 Olaf inherited
          the crown of Denmark from his maternal grandfather as King Olaf II,
          with his mother as guardian; when Haakon VI died in 1380, Olaf also
          inherited the crown of Norway.[3] Margaret became regent of Denmark
          and Norway when Olaf died in 1387, leaving her without an heir.[4] She
          adopted her great-nephew Eric of Pomerania the same year.[5] The
          following year, 1388, Swedish nobles called upon her help against King
          Albert.[6] After Margaret defeated Albert in 1389, her heir Eric was
          proclaimed King of Norway.[4] Eric was subsequently elected King of
          Denmark and Sweden in 1396.[4] His coronation was held in Kalmar on 17
          June 1397.[7] One main impetus for its formation was to block German
          expansion northward into the Baltic region. The main reason for its
          failure to survive was the perpetual struggle between the monarch, who
          wanted a strong unified state, and the Swedish and Danish nobility,
          which did not.[8] The Union lost territory when Orkney and Shetland
          were pledged by Christian I, in his capacity as King of Norway, as
          security against the payment of the dowry of his daughter Margaret,
          betrothed to James III of Scotland in 1468.[9] The money was never
          paid, so in 1472 the islands were annexed by the Kingdom of
          Scotland.[10]

        <h2>Internal Conflicts</h2>
        <p>
          Diverging interests (especially the Swedish nobility's dissatisfaction
          with the dominant role played by Denmark and Holstein) gave rise to a
          conflict that hampered the union in several intervals starting in the
          1430s. The Engelbrekt rebellion, which started in 1434, led to the
          overthrow of King Erik (in Denmark and Sweden in 1439, as well as
          Norway in 1442).[11] The aristocracy sided with the rebels.[11] King
          Erik's foreign policy, in particular his conflict with the Hanseatic
          League, necessitated greater taxation and complicated exports of iron,
          which in turn may have precipitated the rebellion.[11] Discontent with
          the nature of King Erik's regime has also been cited as a motivating
          factor for the rebellion.[11] King Erik also lacked a standing army
          and had limited tax revenues.[11] The death of Christopher of Bavaria
          (he had no heirs) in 1448 ended a period in which the three
          Scandinavian kingdoms were uninterruptedly united for a lengthy
          period.[11] Karl Knutsson Bonde ruled as king of Sweden (1448–1457,
          1464–1465 and 1467–1470), and Christian of Oldenburg was king of
          Denmark (1448–1481), Norway (1450–1481) and Sweden (1457–1464). Karl
          and Christian fought over control of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark,
          leading Christian to seize Sweden from him from 1457 to 1464 before a
          rebellion led Karl to become king of Sweden again.[11] When Karl died
          in 1470, Christian tried to become king of Sweden again, but was
          defeated by Sten Sture the Elder in the 1471 battle of Brunkeberg
          outside Stockholm.[11] After the death of Karl, Sweden was mostly
          ruled by a series of "protectors of the realm" (riksföreståndare),
          with the Danish kings attempting to assert control. First of these
          protectors was Sten Sture, who kept Sweden under his control until
          1497 when the Swedish nobility deposed him. A peasant rebellion led
          Sture to become regent of Sweden again in 1501. After his death,
          Sweden was ruled by Svante Nilsson (1504–1512) and then Svante's son
          Sten Sture the Younger (1512–1520).[11] Sten Sture the Younger was
          killed in the 1520 Battle of Bogesund when the Danish king Christian
          II invaded Sweden with a large army.[11] Subsequently, Christian II
          was crowned King of Sweden, and supporters of Sten Sture were executed
          en masse in the Stockholm Bloodbath.[11] 
          
          <h2>Swedish War of Liberation</h2>

          <p>After the Stockholm Bloodbath, Gustav Vasa (whose father, Erik
          Johansson, was executed) travelled to Dalarna, where he organized a
          rebellion against Christian II.[11] Vasa made an alliance with Lübeck
          and successfully conquered most of Sweden.[11] He was crowned King of
          Sweden in 1523, effectively ending the Kalmar Union.[11] After the
          Northern Seven Years' War, the Treaty of Stettin (1570) saw Frederick
          II renounce all claims to Sweden.[12]<br><br>For more information, click the sources down below:</p>
